       return const Center(
         child: Text('Left Drawer'),
       );
     },
     config: const DrawerConfig(
       side: DrawerSide.left,
       closeOnClickOutside: true,
       closeOnEscapeKey: true,
       closeOnResume: true, // (Android only)
       closeOnBackButton: true, // (Requires a route navigator)
       backdropOpacity: 0.5,
       borderRadius: 24,
     ),
     onOpen: () {
       // Optional callback when the drawer is opened
     },
     onClose: () {
       // Optional callback when the drawer is closed
     },
     controller: drawerController, // Optional controller to programmatically close the drawer
   );
   ```

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `context`                      | `BuildContext`                  | The build context of the widget that is calling the function.                                        |
| `builder`                      | `Widget Function(BuildContext)` | A builder function that returns the widget tree to be displayed inside the drawer.                   |
| `config`                       | `DrawerConfig`                  | A `DrawerConfig` object that allows you to customize the behavior and appearance of the drawer.      |
| `onOpen`                       | `void Function()`               | An optional callback that is called when the drawer is opened.                                       |
| `onClose`                      | `void Function()`               | An optional callback that is called when the drawer is closed.                                       |
| `closeOnEscapeKey`             | `bool`                          | An optional boolean that determines whether the drawer should close when the Escape key is pressed.  |
| `closeOnResume` (Android only) | `bool`                          | An optional boolean that determines whether the drawer should close when the app is resumed.         |

| `controller`                   | `AnyDrawerController`           | A `AnyDrawerController` object that can be used to programmatically close the drawer.                |

> **Note:** ⚠️ The `controller` should be disposed of when it is no longer needed. This can be done by calling the `dispose` method of the controller. It is not automatically disposed of when the drawer is closed. ⚠️

> **Note:** ⚠️ The `closeOnResume` is only applicable on Android devices. ⚠️
> For `closeOnBackButton` to work, the app should have a route navigator. If the app does not have a route navigator, it will throw an error.
